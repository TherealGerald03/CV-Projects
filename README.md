This is a repository i have created for my CV it includes a tkinter GUI and a simple inventory management system based on sqlite. 
To run these projects ensure you have the liabarys installed.  
Run 
import sqlite3
print(sqlite3.version) # to ensure you have sqlite installed on your machine.
tkinter is part of the python standard libary so the tax calculator GUI should be able to run without any pip installations.
The webscaper makes use of the beautifulsoup libary
